# High Performance computing experiment results

For a high performance computing experiment project, generally different experiments are performed to analyze the variation of the execution time, speedup, and the efficieny with the number of threads and the problem size, which is generally the length of an array or a matrix for the purpose of high performance computing. 

In scenarios where there is a potential for parallelization, we an observe that there is a significant increase in the speedup as well as the efficieny when the number of threads are increased, while when there is no potential for an increase in the speedup, we can observe that there is decrease in the speedup as well as the efficency of the algorithm.

This tool can provide a graphical approach to how we can analyze the performance of an algorithm after parallelizing it on multiple threads.

## Steps to run the code

1. Download the python notebook file and upload it in a new python notebook in google research.
2. Upload the file `combines_logs.csv` to the python notebook in google colab.
3. Click the play button in the gutter to run the code and print the graphs.
4. The graphs can be saved as an image locally and can be used in reports.
